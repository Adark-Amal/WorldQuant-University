## WorldQuant-University Data Science Training

### Mode: Online Training

### Description
This online training provides a comprehensive introduction to scientific computing, Python, and related tools used by data scientists. It provides programmers the opportunity to use Python to read, clean, process, and analyze real-world data by following good programming practices such as using functions, choosing the appropriate data structures, and writing readable, maintainable code. Also, to determine the statistical significance of the results of their analysis, one can apply statistical analysis and hypothesis testing.

### Skills Attained:
- Data Analysis
- CSV
- Data Wrangling
- Python Programming
- SQL 
- Pandas
- Numpy 
- Object Oriented Programming
- JSON

### Mini Porjects

> Mini project 1 
>> I used Python to compute Mersenne numbers, using the Lucas-Lehmer test to identify Mersenne numbers that are prime. I had to use Python data structures and core programming principles such as for loops to implement my solution. Further, I had to implement the Sieve of Eratosthenes as a faster solution for checking if numbers are prime, learning  about the importance of algorithm time complexity.

> Mini project 2 
>> I used Object Oriented Programming to create a class that represents a geometric point. I define methods that describe common operations with points such as adding two points together and finding the distance between two points. Finally, I wrote a K-means clustering algorithm that uses the previous defined point class.

> Mini project 3 
>> I used basic Python data structures, functions, and control program flow to answer posed questions over medical data from the British NHS on prescription drugs. I had to use fundamental data wrangling techniques such as joining data sets together, splitting data into groups, and aggregating data into summary statistics.

> Mini project 4 
>> I used the Python package pandas to perform data analysis on a prescription drug data set from the British NHS. I answered questions such as identifying what medical practices prescribe opioids at an usually high rate and what practices are prescribing substantially more rare drugs compared to the rest of the medical practices. I used statistical concepts like z-score to help identify the aforementioned practices.
